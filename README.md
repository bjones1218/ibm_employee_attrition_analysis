🏢 IBM Employee Attrition Analysis

A full exploratory and predictive analysis of HR attrition using a real-world public dataset.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee turnover patterns using IBM’s HR Attrition dataset.
It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictive modeling

Feature engineering

Classification model evaluation

The goal is to identify which factors most influence employee resignations and build models that can predict attrition risk.

📁 Repository Contents

Visualizations, correlation analysis, model performance metrics

🔍 Key Findings

Job satisfaction, overtime, income, and work-life balance are major predictors of attrition

Logistic Regression, Hiearchial and KMeans Clustering ML models were tested

Features such as overtime significantly increase attrition likelihood

Clustering helped visualize employee segments

Final models achieved strong classification performance
